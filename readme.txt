Hi.

Drop or clone the "garrysmod_nextbot_demos" folder into your addons folder.

While ingame, make sure to set the "developer" convar to 1 using the console,
as it will show you useful information to help you understand.

There are notes in the files that will help you learn about NextBots.
They are named based on the purpose of the demo. For example, nb_f_bodymovexy.lua
is for demonstrating the [N]ext[B]ot [F]unction called [BodyMoveXY].

Please use these demos for educational purposes only.

Have fun!
